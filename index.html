        <h1>Pmlp-alarm</h1>

<p>Poor Man's Low Power Alarm is a tiny perl script to alarm you
when the laptop power is low. I wrote it because I run
<a href="http://antix.mepis.org">antix</a> on my old computers
and because icewm does not seem to have an auditory
low power alarm program.

        <h3>Using pmlp-alarm</h3>

<p>Pmlp-alarm makes use of <a href="http://ckhung.github.com/beeptune/">
beeptune</a> so please make sure that (1) you have installed
the beep package (either rpm or deb) and (2) you have
unmuted the beep channel using alsamixer.
However, you don't need to download beeptune because
a copy of the bare beeptune script (without documents and examples)
is included in pmlp-alarm. Once these are taken care of, you need to:
<ol>
<li>Copy both <code>pmlp-alarm</code> and <code>beeptune</code>
to <code>/usr/bin</code>
<li>(Optional) If you are running icewm like me, you can
enable display of power percentage on the taskbar by setting
<code>TaskBarShowAPMStatus=1</code> in <code>~/.icewm/preferences</code>
and restarting icewm.
<li>Execute <code>pmlp-alarm -v 2</code> on the command line,
watch its output, and wait for the battery to run into low power.
By default, pmlp-alarm starts beeping when the batter drops below 30%,
and beeps more urgently when it drops below 10% and even more so below 5%.
<li>If it works fine on the command line, then add this command
<code>pmlp-alarm</code> to <code>/etc/rc.local</code>
You don't need <code>-v 2</code> since you can't see the message anyway.
</ol>

        <h3>Options</h3>

<p>The <code>-v</code> option controls verbosity.
You can use <code>-v 1</code> to make pmlp-alarm
print more information, and <code>-v 2</code>
to make it print even more messages.

<p>You can specify the time interval (in seconds)
between battery level checks when power is relatively high
using the <code>-s</code> option.
For example <code>-s 900</code> means checking the
battery power level every 15 minutes.

<p>The more complex option <code>-l</code> defines
a list of <dfn>power level specifications</dfn> separated by spaces.
A power level specification is of the form
<code><span class="subst">mm</span>%<span class="subst">nn</span>s
{<span class="subst">cmd</span>}</code>, which asks
pmlp-alarm to change checking interval to
every <span class="subst">nn</span> seconds
and execute the alarm command <span class="subst">cmd</span>
once the power level drops below <span class="subst">mm</span>%.
For example, the power level specification
<code>30%180s {beep -f 800 -l 200}</code>
asks pmlp-alarm to check the power level and run the alarm
command <code>beep -f 800 -l 200</code> every 3 minutes
once the power level drops below 30%.

<p>Other possible auditory alarm commands include <code>mpg321</code>,
<code>playmidi</code>, and <code>beeptune</code>.
Each of these commands requires a song file as an argument.
Be sure to give full path names.
If you are using beeptune as the alarm command,
however, pmlp-alarm provides three builtin tunes
so that you don't need any separate song file.
You reference them in the alarm command as
<code>#warn</code>, <code>#serious</code>, and <code>#urgent</code>,
respectively. So for example,
<code>30%180s {beeptune #warn}</code>
asks pmlp-alarm to check the power level and play the <code>#warn</code>
builtin beep tune every 3 minutes once the power level drops below 30%.

<p><strong>IMPORTANT: power level specifications
must be presented in decreasing order of power level.</strong>

<p>The default behavior of beeptune is as if 
the following option is given on the command line:
<code>-l '30%180s {beeptune #warn} 10%60s {beeptune #serious} 5%20s
{beeptune #urgent}'</code>

<p>You can change the builtin tunes or add more builtin tunes.
Please see the <code>$builtin_tunes</code> variable
initialization at the end of the script as well as
the documentation for beeptune for more details.
