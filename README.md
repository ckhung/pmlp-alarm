pmlp-alarm
==========

Poor Man's Low Power Alarm is a tiny perl script to alarm you
when the laptop power is low. I wrote it because I run
antix on my old computers and because icewm does not seem
to have an auditory low power alarm program.

See [project homepage](http://ckhung.github.com/pmlp-alarm/) for more
information on using pmlp-alarm.
